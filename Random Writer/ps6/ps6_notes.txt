TextWriter, RandWriter
======================
To implement random writer program, we used map and vector data structure as follows:
   keyfreq ---- map<string, vector<int>>

we use k_gram as the key of mapping. At the data side we have vector of 129 elements, where index 0 to 127 are used to keep frequency of char(idx) that following the k_gram, and index 128 (the last index) is used to keep the frequency of k_gram in the whole text.

Basically the program take k_gram length from input argument, and then start to parse input file and create keyfreq to keep the frequency of all k_gram and k+1_gram.
Once the k_gram frequency is ready, we take one k_gram randomly from keyfreq and use it as the initial k_gram, starting the output.
Then we start to take one character at the time randomly, the random should reflected the distributed frequency character for this k_gram.

Test
----
We test the application with several k values, starting from 0 up to 6 or 7, and we check the output. The largest k value, the most perfect sentences created.
Also we test the application using BOOST function, to check the exceptions inside the program.
